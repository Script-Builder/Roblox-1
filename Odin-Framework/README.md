# Odin Framework


Odin framework is an open source framework which should simplify the use of Roblox while adding security and strong freedom. There are plans to add small administation to this framework for more functionality but for now it will mainly compose of security. 

Since this is open source ideas and contributions are welcome!

##Features and Ideas

* **Server Log**
* **Encryption with serializer**
* **Administation Module**
* **External and Internal Modules**
* **Secure client to server (and vice versa) communicaiton**
* **Http storage (Giving a quota to your upload limit)**


##Auto-Installer

```Lua
    --[[
    Odin Installer
    ]]--
    
    local _ENV = getfenv(0);
    local _NENV = {};
    
    --//This is unfinished as the framework isn't even ready
```
